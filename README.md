# ASCII Map Maker
## A JSON-based tilemap editor

### Why ASCII Map Maker ?
This is a web tool I created to assist in future game development. It allows the user to quickly and easily create ascii maps on web, no installation or configuration required.

This can simply be used as a tilemap mockup tool but it also grants users the ability to associate JSON data any tile via the tile pallate tool.

### Features
 - a limited set of common paint tools (brush, fill, erase etc.)
 - layering tool
 - tile pallette editor
 - local storage save/load
 - tilemap export

### Planned Features
 - more paint tools (shapes, brush sizes, eye-dropper)
 - tilemap import via raw image or csv
 - persistent database
 - performance optimization (tilemaps are still quite limited in size)
